A very basic live editor for README files written in react. It uses [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) for the HTML and markdown conversions. I'm also using the styling of the GitHub README's, to hopefully make it as close of an experience as possible for the writer.

## My To-Do List

This is a list of things that I still plan on working on when I get the chance:

#### Features

- [ ] Add ability to turn on spell check
- [ ] Add templates
- [ ] Add ability to import a README (.md or maybe straight from GitHub?)
- [ ] Add ability to save
- [ ] Add a markdown cheatsheet
- [ ] Add buttons for markdown (kind of like the Word text formatting at the top)
